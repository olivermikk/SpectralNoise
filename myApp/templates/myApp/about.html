                What happens when technology is encounters sound?
            </p>
            <p>
                Spectral Noise is a creative exploration by Oliver Mikk into the space where audio meets visuals.
                It's a browser-based tool designed to reimagine how we experience sound — not just through hearing, but through seeing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're a musician looking for new inspiration, a visual artist curious about sonic forms, or simply someone
                fascinated by the relationship between sound and image — this is a space for experimentation and discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, Spectral Noise takes audio input — from a microphone or an uploaded file — and transforms it into a live,
                evolving visual experience. It analyzes the sound in real time, extracting elements like amplitude, frequency,
                and spectrum, and turns them into generative drawings that develop as the music unfolds.

            </p>
            <p>
                Each visualizer within the app is designed to offer a different lens through which to see your sound.
                Some respond to rhythm, others to pitch, tone, or texture — no two are quite the same.
                The result is a growing collection of audio-reactive artworks, each one giving a unique perspective on how
                sound can look.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's nothing to install — just open it in your browser and start experimenting.
                And because the platform is built to be expandable, new visualizers can be added over time,
                keeping the creative possibilities wide open.
